# Steps to configue app:

1. Clone the repository to your android studio.
2. Do not upgrade the project, as it will make the environment non-suitable for the dependencies that I have used.
3. Then simply, go to the file " MainActivity.kt" and run the emulator.
4. The API used is a free public api, so everything has already been added to the code. Hence, anymore configuration is not required

# Project Features:

- It is a simple kotlin app which fetches the list of the tv show.
- The data is displayed in the form of cards and scrollview is enabled, so that the list is scroller horizontally.
- The app fetches the name of the show along with the picture of the show via API.
- The API is simply applied by parsiing the JSON data in a Kotlin Class File and modified to get the show name and the image.

# Referrences:

-I have used several solutions from google and youtube to solve the dependenies issues and gradle issues that I faced during the project. Also for scrollview mode.
